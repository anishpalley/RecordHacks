Hey there, it's me,  
I've been watching as you dunk on every spree,  
Your highlights, they’re a dream,  
They say that pressure's supposed to build ya,  
But you just keep on stealin'.  
Hey, can you see?  
You’re the king, and
LeBron on the court, he flies,  
Dribbling past defenders, oh my,  
To dunk on the foes like a king on his throne,  
But when he shoots, the crowd lets out a groan.  
LeBron with the moves, he’s in his prime,
To tell you I'm dunking on all of the charts,  
But it don’t matter, I’m still breaking new hearts every score.  
Hello, how’s your game?  
It’s so typical of me to flaunt all my skills, I’m soaring.  
I hope that you see
Hello, it’s LeBron time (LeBron time)  
I must've dunked a thousand times (Thousand times)  
To show you I’m the king of this basketball run  
But when I score, you know I'm always on a roll  
Hello, I’m a hoops guy (
Slam dunks on the court, (On the court)  
LeBron’s the king, he’s got the shine (Got the shine)  
With every move, he’s breaking ankles, so fun,  
But when he’s gone, where’d all the fans go?
Hello, King James, so fly (So fly)  
You dunk like a beast, it’s no lie (No lie)  
You’re dribbling past all those guys,  
With a three-pointer splash, you light up the sky.  
You're chasing those rings, what a ride!
