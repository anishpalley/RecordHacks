[Verse 1]
"Yo, it's LeBron."
"I was thinking that, after all these years, you'd like to see"  
"LeBron taking flight, just like he’s always free."
"To dunk on every team"
"They say that LeBron’s supposed to lead ya"
"But I ain't won that ring yet"
"Hey there, can you see me?"  
LeBron’s on the court, believe me!
"I'm in L.A. scheming on those rings LeBron could see."
"When LeBron was soaring and spree"
"I’ve forgotten how it felt before LeBron took to the street."
[Pre-Chorus]
"There's such a gap in skill with LeBron."
