Drivin' through the math, gotta find that limit now,  
Got my bounds all set but it’s tricky, oh wow,  
Integrals of infinite, they’re givin’ me a scare,  
Convergence or divergence, better check if it’s there.
Improper integrals,
Improper integrals, maybe  
(Oh-oh)  
The limits can drive you wavy  
(Oh-oh)  
Will it converge or go crazy?  
(Ah-ah-ah)  
When the bounds are just too hazy?  
As x approaches a value,  
(Oh-oh)
Improper integrals, they’re a bit wild,  
Convergence or divergence, it’s a math child.  
Watch those limits when you’re set to solve,  
Got to study hard, so your skills evolve.  
Sometimes they blow up, you’ll start to sweat,  
But don
Integrals tonight, limits goin' to the edge,  
They're divergin', got my brain in quite a wedge.  
Functions growin' wild, and they’re never gonna stop,  
Checkin' convergence, gotta make those bounds all fit,  
It's tricky,  
But I know
We're only integratin', baby  
And I've been thinkin'  
'Bout limits lately  
Does it ever make you hazy?  
When bounds are going on, oh,  
To infinity, it’s wrong, oh,  
We try to find that area  
But it’s so much scar
(Ah-ah-ah)  
Just how wide the bounds of integrals?  
(Ooh)  
Divergin' like a random series,  
(Ooh)  
Limit approaches, it gets so risky,  
(Ooh)  
But there's still math, so don’t you dread it,
(Oh)
Improper integrals, they confuse me too  
(Oh)  
Limits on the edge, do I even dare to test?  
(Oh)  
Infinity's a scary place, I can't help but feel stressed  
Diving into ranges, where the functions must be checked  
Got
We're diving into math now, baby  
(Ooh)  
With limits that are boundless,  
Maybe.  
And I’ve been calculating,  
The area that’s unshaken,  
From zero to infinity,  
It’s making me go crazy!  
Those improper integrals,  
They
Does it ever make you fuzzy?  
Just how wild these bounds get crazy?  
Improper integrals, they’re shady,  
Limits are what drives us wavy.  
(Oh-ooh)  
Diving deep, and then we’re hopeful,  
Finding areas so colorful,  
But
But there’s limits we can’t evade, oh  
(Oh-oh-oh)  
Even when the bounds get crazy  
(Yeah)  
They’ll diverge or they’ll amaze me  
(Oh)  
They’ll converge or drive me mad too!
